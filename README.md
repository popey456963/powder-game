# Powder Game

## Description 
Powder Game (powder-game) is a game about falling powders and stationary block particles. Different powders fall from the sky or can be spawned in to form various patterns. Different powders have different behaviours. 

## Function 
The server file to run is [index.js](index.js "The Main Server File"). First of all, the JavaScript and CSS needs to be bundled using parcel. Run `npm run watch` to do this; the code is output in the `public/dist` folder. Then, after installing nodemon, run `npm run nodemon` to run the server. The server should start on port 9876.
